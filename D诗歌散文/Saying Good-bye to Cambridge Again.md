**Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again**   
--by Xu Zhimo    
Very quietly I take my leave  
As quietly as I came here;  
Quietly I wave good-bye  
To the rosy clouds in the western sky.  
The golden willows by the riverside  
Are young brides in the setting sun;  
Their reflections on the shimmering waves  
Always linger in the depth of my heart.  
The floating heart growing in the sludge  
Sways leisurely under the water;  
In the gentle waves of Cambridge  
I would be a water plant!  
That pool under the shade of elm trees  
Holds not water but the rainbow from the sky;  
Shattered to pieces among the duckweeds  
Is the sediment of a rainbow-like dream?  
To seek a dream? Just to pole a boat upstream  
To where the green grass is more verdant;  
Or to have the boat fully loaded with starlight  
And sing aloud in the splendor of starlight.  
But I cannot sing aloud  
Quietness is my farewell music;  
Even summer insects heap silence for me  
Silent is Cambridge tonight!  
Very quietly I take my leave  
As quietly as I came here;  
Gently I flick my sleeves  
Not even a wisp of cloud will I bring away
