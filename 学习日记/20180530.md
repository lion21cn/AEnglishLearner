#### An nice music from Jasmine Thompson's You Are My Sunshine.<br>

The **other** night **dear** / as-I lay **sleeping**.<br>

I **dreamed** I **held you** in my arms.<br>

When I **awake** dear.<br>

I **was mistaken**.<br>

So I **hung** my **head** and I **cried**.<br>

You are my **sunshine** /my **only** sunshine.<br>

You **make** me **happy**/ when **skies** are gry.<br>

You'll **never** **know** **dear** /how much I **love** you.<br>

**Please** **don't take** /my **sunshine** away.<br>

I'll **always love** you/ and **make** you **happy**.<br>

And **nothing knows** **good**/ comes sweet.<br>

But if you **leave** me/ to love another.<br>

You have shattered all of/ my dreams.<br>

You are my sushine/ my only sunshine.<br>

You make me **happy**/ when skies are gry.<br>

You'll never know dear/ **how much** I **love** you.<br>

Please **don't** take/ **my** sunshine away.<br>
