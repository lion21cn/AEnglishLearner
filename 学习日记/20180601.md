### Diary

My god just told me English is like a password if you don't use it for a long time you'll forget it. As result, If you really want to learn English well, you should speak english every day at least during learning.Because, while you use the new language to express your idea, you'll find the problems that you never meeted before,and in order to express your  ideas, you must solve the problems first. When the problems be happend repeatly, if you have enough patience to solve them again and again, then the  knowledges will be puted  into your long time memory. At finaly you will speak out a fluent English .
