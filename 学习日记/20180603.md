We are feeling nature.

We havn't gone to the GaoBang Mountain for a long long time. we go for climing every week last year . our kids should go for study english from this year so we haven't got time 
go outside . but today we decide to go there for A while to have A rest .when we walk on the road listening birds singing ,sea lots of people walk down and up,we feal so lease and happy.
